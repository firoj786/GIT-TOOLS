Fundamentals of SCM(Source Code Management) Repositories.
------------------------------------
These are softwares being developement by different
Organizations and are distributed as comercial/open 
Source SCM repository software to manage/maintain source 
Code and distribute across the people in the team.

There distribute SCM Software into to parts.
1- SCM Server:- This has to be installed on the central server
                Machine of the organization and the source code 
                Should be deposited here.
 . Keeps track of files like 
    -When it was created 
    -When it has been modified
    -Who created / how many times files are modified / who made changes.
   For every write on file on the repository the SCM server keeps the
   Versioning of the file.
2- SCM Client:- Connect to the SCM Server in pulling the source code
                Or pushing the source code onto the server.
---Lock-Modify-Unlock Strategy [Problems]---
# Many cases developer while working on a bigger requirement might have 
To grab lock on multiple files of the projrct. eventually his changes 
Takes lot of time to finish as it is a big requirementn an might have hold 
The lock on the files for lot if time.that makes the other team members
Wait indefinetly loosing their productive.
#Deadlocks are common
#If someone locks the files and goon a long vacation then others in team
  have no choice apart from waiting for team
